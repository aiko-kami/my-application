Dear Tailwind Labs team,

My name is Adrian-loup, and I am a 32-year-old French business analyst and product owner for Amadeus IT Group, a major Global Distribution System (a company in charge of developing IT solutions for travel industry actors, ranging from flight searches to hotel bookings, car rentals, airport security, and payment systems).

I discovered Tailwind CSS two years ago, and since then, it has become an indispensable tool in my toolkit, and most likely my favorite. I am truly amazed by the work you've accomplished with the framework. Its ease of use and remarkable efficiency make it an exceptional tool, profoundly enhancing the developer experience.

As an experienced business analyst, I have a problem-solving mindset and am accustomed to identifying issues, brainstorming solutions, and implementing strategies to address them. This role also allows me to do something I really enjoy: being the interface between customers, project managers and developers, a lot of different profiles speaking different languages. This requires strong communication skills, as it involves conveying complex ideas and presenting solutions to stakeholders with the utmost precision and clarity.

With the hat of product owner, I've proven my capabilities to analyze complex requirements, ensuring that solutions perfectly align with user needs. This user-centric approach aligns well with the realm of design engineering, where crafting intuitive and user-friendly interfaces and tools is key. Moreover, my adaptability has enabled me to succeed in dynamic environments with shifting priorities. I also have a keen eye for detail, ensuring that designs are precise and consistent.

At this point in my letter, you have probably understood that while I hold an engineering degree in Computer science, I am not a professional developer. However, I possess a strong passion for web development and web design, which I've pursued independently. I am working on a project close to my heart: building a collaborative project creation and management platform. I like to describe it as a mix between Kickstarter and Meetup where the idea is to help people bring their projects to life by making project creators meet talents. It is not about getting money or finding a job but simply allowing talents to meet and build something together (such as forming a music band, making a film, creating a podcast, developing an indie video game...). I completed the backend part ([panda-server](https://github.com/aiko-kami/panda-server) on my GitHub) using Node.js and MongoDB because I love these technologies. I started the frontend in March ([sheepy](https://github.com/aiko-kami/sheepy) on my GitHub) using Next.js and Tailwind CSS (thank you very much!). I have not connected the frontend to the backend yet, I want to complete most of the template pages first. I fully recognize that it is an amateur project far from perfect. However, I put a lot of effort into ensuring that every pixel and interaction is meticulously crafted.

My hands-on experience with Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS aligns perfectly with the requirements of the role, and I am eager to leverage these technologies to design and build ambitious interfaces for Tailwind Labs. I am filled with enthusiasm about this opportunity to transition into a design engineering journey and would be delighted to be part of such an outstanding company like yours, contributing to pushing the boundaries of innovation. I am confident that my diverse skill set and extensive experiences make me a strong fit for this role as a design engineer, and I am eager to bring my passion for design and engineering to your team.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Adrian-loup
